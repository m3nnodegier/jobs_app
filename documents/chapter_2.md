We are going to build a job board website, In which we will be having:

List a job
Details of the Job post
Create a job post
Update the job
Delete the job
Permissions (Authorization required, only superuser and the original author can delete)
Authentication ( Registration and Login )
Test our Endpoints
Test Coverage
Webapp for Jobboard
We will be following something called Test-Driven Development in which we will be creating a unit-test for each of the components, then think then implement our feature.
